Fade out and no-op the nav rows of locked modules instead of giving them upsell pages.

A module the wedding is not entitled to no longer has a page. `isModuleLocked` derives the lock from the wedding's own entitlement set, `ModuleShell` coerces a locked module back to Overview, and the row stays in the rail and the sheet — faded, `aria-disabled`, navigating nowhere. Resting a pointer on it for three seconds, holding keyboard focus on it for the same delay, or clicking it opens a popover naming the module and offering an Upgrade button that is inert until checkout exists. The click path matters: the hover card ignores touch pointers, so a hover-only row would be dead on a phone.

The command palette and the Overview vendors card drop a locked module rather than offering a route that lands somewhere else, and Overview no longer fetches vendors for a wedding that cannot open them. `UpsellPanel` and its two dedicated pages are gone. Server enforcement is unchanged: the 402 `payment_required` gate stays where it was.
