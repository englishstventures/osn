Link the three places that shape a household's invite message.

The message's first line is written in the invite builder's Message section,
the code on its last line takes the style chosen at creation and changed in
Invite → Codes, and the message is copied from Guests → Households. Each of the
three now carries a line naming the other two. A place the reader's role cannot
open is named without a link, with the role that can.

A link that crosses modules lands on its sub-tab in one move rather than
stopping at the module's default view first, and one that leads to the message
editor opens the builder on its Message section. Focus moves to the new view's
heading.

On Guests → Households, "Copy message" now waits until the host's own first line
has loaded. Before, a copy made the moment the cached list appeared could send
the default line instead.
