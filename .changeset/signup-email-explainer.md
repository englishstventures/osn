Say what the sign-up email address is for, beside the Email field.

The address does three jobs and the form named none of them: it verifies the
account by six-digit code (no account row exists until the code is accepted), it
is the emailed-code way back into an account whose passkeys are all gone, and it
receives security notices. The second is the one that should steer which address
a person types, and it was the least visible.

`InfoPopover` — the circled-glyph button that was already doing this job on
`@pulse/web`'s create-event form — moves to `@osn/ui` as
`@osn/ui/ui/info-popover`, so `Register` can use it too. Two new props: `glyph`
picks the character (`?` still the default, so the seven `@pulse/web` call sites
are unchanged) and `placement` picks the side. `Register`'s Email label gets an
`i` that opens above the label, because Kobalte's default `"bottom"` would open
the panel over the input the reader is about to type into.

`@pulse/web` keeps both call sites and behaviour; its copy of the component and
that copy's test both move to `@osn/ui`, so the coverage travels with the file
rather than disappearing.

Two of the five moved tests asserted nothing and were rewritten rather than
carried over. The toggle test ended in `expect(!content || closedParent ||
expandedParent).toBeTruthy()`, where `expandedParent` matches while the popover
is still open — it passed either way; and the Escape test fired the key and then
ended in a comment. Both now read Kobalte's disclosure state directly
(`aria-expanded`, plus `data-closed`/`data-expanded` on the panel), which is what
the exit animation keeping the panel mounted had made awkward to assert. Four
more tests cover the chosen glyph, `type="button"`, keyboard reachability, and a
click that does not submit the surrounding form — that last one with a positive
control, so it cannot pass in an environment that dispatches no submit at all.
