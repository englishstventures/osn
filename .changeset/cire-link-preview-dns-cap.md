Cap the DNS lookups one registry link preview can make at 12. Each lookup is
two DNS-over-HTTPS requests, so a preview now makes at most 28 outbound
requests of its own however many image hosts the page lists. Before this, a
page naming hundreds of hosts made the preview resolve each one in turn. A host
past the budget is refused without a query and never offered as an image, and
the preview logs one warning when that happens.
