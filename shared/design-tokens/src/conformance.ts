/**
 * The contract's conformance test: does an app's token mapping actually clear
 * the contrast floors the contract promises?
 *
 * ## Why this is not the cire harness moved sideways
 *
 * `cire/host/tests/styles/tokens.test.ts` — the thing this generalises — finds
 * tokens with a regex over **literal** `--name: oklch(…)` declarations inside a
 * block located by exact string match. That works there because cire's ramps
 * *are* literals. A contract mapping never is: it is `--osn-ink: var(--text)`,
 * pointing at a token declared somewhere else in the file, possibly itself
 * pointing at a third. There is no literal to match, so the regex approach
 * finds nothing and silently asserts about an empty set — a test that cannot
 * fail. Hence the `var()` resolver below, which is the substance of this file.
 *
 * ## What it proves, and what it cannot
 *
 * It reads the stylesheet, not the browser. It therefore knows nothing about
 * the cascade beyond the scopes you name, cannot see a colour injected at
 * runtime (cire's per-wedding palette lands on `<html>` from the server), and
 * will not notice an element that sits on a ground the mapping never mentions.
 * It is a **drift guard**: every ratio here passed when the mapping was tuned,
 * and this stops a later nudge to one lightness quietly pushing secondary ink
 * under 4.5:1. Real rendering is the browser tier's job.
 *
 * ## Alpha
 *
 * Half the ink tokens in this monorepo are translucent, and a naive ratio
 * overstates every one of them. A translucent colour has no contrast ratio on
 * its own, so each is composited over the ground it is being measured against
 * first — in sRGB, because that is where a browser does it.
