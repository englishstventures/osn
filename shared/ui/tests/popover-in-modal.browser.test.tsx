/**
 * A popover opened from inside a `Modal`.
 *
 * `Modal` is `<dialog>` + `showModal()`, so it paints in the **top layer** —
 * above every stacking context in the document, by definition. `Popover`
 * portals its panel to `<body>` and positions it with a `z-index`. Those two
 * facts together mean the panel lands *behind* the dialog however large that
 * `z-index` is: rendered, measurable, announced by a screen reader, and
 * completely unclickable.
 *
 * Nothing below this tier can catch it. happy-dom has no top layer and no
 * layout, so every DOM assertion about the panel passes while the real thing is
 * invisible. It is also not a hypothetical: cire hit exactly this with its
 * Add-to-Calendar menu, which now escapes by promoting itself into the top layer
 * with the native `popover` attribute. This file is why that workaround does not
 * have to be repeated at every call site.
