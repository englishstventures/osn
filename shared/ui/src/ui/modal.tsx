/**
 * A modal dialog, built on the platform's own `<dialog>` element.
 *
 * ## Why not Kobalte
 *
 * `@shared/ui` already ships a Kobalte-backed `Dialog`, and `@musubi/social` and
 * `@pulse/web` use it. This exists because `@cire/invites` and `@cire/landing`
 * carry no Kobalte at all, and **it does not fit**: measured 2026-09-16,
 * importing `@kobalte/core/dialog` costs 15.3 KB gzip on top of a bare Solid
 * bundle (2,270 → 17,564 bytes), against ~11.7 KB of headroom in each of those
 * two apps. Adopting it there would mean re-baselining the guest site's budget
 * by roughly 9% — on the surface people load on mobile data at a wedding.
 *
 * *Measured — `bun build <entry> --minify --target=browser` from `shared/ui`, with
 * and without the import, then `gzip -9`. Budgets in
 * `scripts/bundle-size-budgets.txt`.*
 *
 * Most of what that 15 KB buys is behaviour the browser now does natively.
 * `showModal()` gives a focus trap, Escape-to-close, background inertness and a
 * `::backdrop` pseudo-element, all from the platform. What is left is the part
 * below: reactive open/close, a close-on-backdrop-click that does not misfire,
 * and the accessible name.
 *
 * ## The top layer is the point, not a detail
 *
 * A `showModal()` dialog renders in the **top layer** — outside the normal flow
 * entirely. That makes it immune to the trap that has already cost this
 * repository a bug: a `transform` on any ancestor turns that ancestor into the
 * containing block for `position: fixed` descendants *and* into a stacking
 * context no `z-index` escapes. Motion One leaves its final inline `transform`
 * on everything it animates, which is what left cire's RSVP toast mispositioned
 * and painted underneath the sheet it fired beneath
 * (`wiki/architecture/frontend-patterns.md`). Nine hand-rolled overlays in this
 * repository are `position: fixed` inside a portal, each of them one animated
 * ancestor away from that. The top layer cannot be captured that way, so the
 * whole class of bug stops being possible rather than being avoided by
 * convention.
 *
 * It also means **no `z-index` and no portal**: the top layer paints above every
 * stacking context in the document by definition, and the element may live
 * wherever it is written.
 *
 * ## Keep it mounted across the close
 *
 * The one thing a caller has to get right. `Modal` animates its exit, and it
 * can only do that while the element is still in the document — so drive
 * {@link ModalProps.open} and leave the component mounted:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // Right: the modal stays, `open` moves.
 * <Modal open={sheet() !== null} onClose={() => setSheet(null)} label="…">…</Modal>
 *
 * // Wrong: `Show` unmounts the dialog the instant `sheet()` goes null, so the
 * // exit has nothing left to play and the sheet blinks away.
 * <Show when={sheet()}>{(s) => <Modal open onClose={…}>…</Modal>}</Show>
 * ```
 *
 * The wrong form is not broken — it closes, restores focus and leaves nothing
 * inert — it just loses the animation, silently.
 *
 * **The children are not mounted while it is closed.** That falls out of the
 * rule above rather than contradicting it: the `<dialog>` stays, its contents
 * do not. Without it, a modal that is merely *available* renders its body into
 * every page that offers it — which in `cire/host` meant a live invite preview
 * rendering twice, once in the sticky side pane and once inside a closed
 * dialog, competing for the same accessible name. The children mount when
 * `open` goes true and unmount once the exit has finished, so an expensive body
 * costs nothing until it is asked for and is still there to be animated away.

/**
 * The stylesheet `Modal` injects once per document.
 *
 * Two things live here rather than in Tailwind utilities. The backdrop is a
 * `::backdrop` pseudo-element, which cannot be targeted by a class on the
 * element; and the entry/exit choreography needs `@starting-style`, which has
 * no utility form either. Both are scoped to `.ui-modal` rather than to
 * `dialog` so an app's own `<dialog>` elements are left alone.
 *
 * ## The backdrop mixes the app's ground rather than using black
 *
 * `color-mix` against `--ui-ground-deep`: on a light theme a black scrim reads
 * as a hole punched in the page, and on a dark one it is nearly invisible.
 * Mixing the app's own ground keeps the scrim in the same family as whatever it
 * is dimming.
 *
 * ## Entry is pure CSS. Exit cannot be.
 *
 * Entry is `@starting-style`, which needs no JavaScript at all: the browser
 * takes the from-state at the moment the element is first rendered. Safari has
 * had it since 17.5; older engines simply show the dialog immediately, which is
 * a degradation rather than a broken state.
 *
 * Exit is the part that has to be held open from JavaScript, and it is worth
 * saying exactly why, because the CSS-only answer looks like it should work.
 * `close()` removes the dialog from the top layer *immediately*, so an exit
 * transition has nothing left to paint. The platform's fix is the `overlay`
 * property with `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`, which defers that
 * removal — and `overlay` is **Chrome and Edge only**, unsupported in Safari
 * and Firefox. On the surface this component was built for, cire's guest site,
 * most traffic is mobile Safari, so a CSS-only exit would mean the dialog
 * blinking away for nearly everyone who sees it.
 *
 * So `close()` is deferred in `Modal` instead: it sets `data-closing`, lets
 * these rules run, and calls `close()` once the element's own animations have
 * finished. No `overlay`, no `allow-discrete`, and the same behaviour in every
 * engine.
 *
 * ## The durations are tokens
 *
 * An app that wants different timing sets `--ui-modal-enter` / `--ui-modal-exit`
 * rather than restyling the component. The defaults are cire's existing modal
 * choreography, which is the only hand-rolled one this replaces.
