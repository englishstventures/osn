/**
 * Where the panel's portal should land.
 *
 * `<body>` normally. But {@link Modal} is `<dialog>` + `showModal()`, and a
 * modal dialog paints in the **top layer**, above every stacking context in the
 * document — so a panel portalled to `<body>` while one is open is unclickable
 * at any `z-index`, this component's `z-50` included. It is still laid out and
 * still announced; a pointer simply lands on the dialog.
 *
 * Promoting the panel into the top layer as well does not fix it: Kobalte
 * positions with `position: absolute`, whose containing block changes once an
 * element is promoted, and the panel ends up painted somewhere the hit test
 * never reaches.
 *
 * Mounting INTO the open dialog does fix it, and is the more honest description
 * of what is happening anyway: a popover opened from inside a modal belongs to
 * that modal. It inherits the dialog's top-layer promotion, keeps Kobalte's
 * positioning intact, and needs nothing from the call site.
 *
 * `dialog:modal` matches only a dialog opened with `showModal()`, so a
 * non-modal `<dialog open>` — which is an ordinary stacking context — is left
 * alone and keeps the `<body>` portal.
