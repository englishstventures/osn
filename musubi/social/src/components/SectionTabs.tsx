/**
 * The underline tab bar the Connections and Settings pages share.
 *
 * Both pages had the same nineteen classes written out twice, and the two
 * copies were byte-identical — which is the failure mode this exists to end,
 * not a stylistic preference. A change to the selected-state colour had to be
 * made in two files, and nothing said so.
 *
 * ## Why not `@osn/ui`'s `Tabs`
 *
 * That one is Kobalte's, and it is a *pill* tab: a filled accent chip, with its
 * own `Tabs.Content` structure and roving arrow-key focus. This is a different
 * visual and a different shape of page — Settings is deep-linked by URL
 * fragment and its sections are `<Show>` blocks, not panels owned by a tab
 * component. Reskinning the pill to look like an underline would leave one
 * component with two unrelated appearances, so this stays musubi's.
 *
 * ## Tabs, honestly named
 *
 * `aria-current="page"` rather than `role="tab"` and `aria-selected`. The full
 * tab pattern is a contract — a `tablist`, a `tabpanel` per tab, arrow keys
 * moving selection, one tab stop for the set — and a bar that claims the roles
 * without keeping the contract is worse for a screen-reader user than plain
 * buttons, because it promises navigation that is not there. Reach for
 * `@osn/ui`'s `Tabs` when the page can own real panels.
