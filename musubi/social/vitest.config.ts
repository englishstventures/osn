/**
 * Two test projects, deliberately separated — the same split `@cire/host` runs,
 * and for the same reason.
 *
 * The `unit` project's environment parses no stylesheet and computes no layout.
 * It can assert that an element carries `base:bg-osn-accent`, but never that the
 * class emitted any CSS, that it won the cascade, or what colour actually
 * reached the pixel. Since the design-token contract landed, that gap is the
 * whole question: a contract utility is three hops from a value
 * (`bg-osn-accent` → `--color-osn-accent` → `--osn-accent` → `--primary`), and
 * every one of those hops can be broken in a way the fast tier reports as green.
 * A class Tailwind cannot generate emits nothing at all, silently.
 *
 * Browser tests are named `*.browser.test.ts(x)` and excluded from `unit` by
 * that name, so every file lands in exactly one project.
