 * `Dialog` costs 15.3 KB gzip, against roughly 11.7 KB of headroom in each of
 * the two cire apps that carry no Kobalte at all.
 *
 * The bench below is the part worth seeing. A `showModal()` dialog renders in
 * the **top layer**, so it is above every stacking context in the document by
 * definition — including the deliberately hostile one here, which has a
 * `transform` and the largest `z-index` there is. That ancestor is exactly the
 * shape Motion One leaves behind on anything it animates, and it is what put
 * cire's RSVP toast underneath the sheet it fired beneath. Nine hand-rolled

 * Two things worth doing here rather than reading about:

 * **Watch the close, not the open.** Entry is `@starting-style` — pure CSS, no
 * JavaScript. Exit cannot be: `close()` drops a dialog out of the top layer
 * immediately, and the platform's fix for that (`overlay` with
 * `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`) is Chrome and Edge only. `Modal`
 * defers the `close()` call instead, which is why the sheet fades out here the
 * same way it would in Safari.

 * **Drag the durations to zero** and the close still works — that is the
 * reduced-motion path, which each app reaches through its own global clamp.
