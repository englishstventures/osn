/**
 * Rewrite arbitrary Tailwind type values onto the contract's scales.
 *
 * The monorepo carries 1,062 bracketed `text-[…]`, `tracking-[…]` and
 * `leading-[…]` values across 93 distinct font sizes, which is not a house
 * style — it is drift. `@shared/design-tokens` publishes seven type steps and
 * a closed old→new table (`SCALE_MIGRATION`); this applies it.
 *
 * ## Why a script rather than an afternoon of editing
 *
 * A thousand hand-edits is unreviewable, and a reviewer reading that diff has
 * no way to check anything except the sites themselves. With a transform, the
 * thing to review is the **table** — which lives in `@shared/design-tokens`
 * because the mapping is the decision and this file is only the thing that
 * carries it out — plus the report below, which says what was left alone.
 *
 * ## What it must never touch, and how it avoids each
 *
 * **Computed values.** `text-[calc(clamp(2rem,5vw,3rem)*var(--invite-heading-scale,1))]`
 * is not a size; it is an expression whose value depends on a custom property
 * an organiser sets. Snapping it to a step deletes a feature people pay for.
 * These are skipped by looking for `var(`, `calc(`, `clamp(`, `min(`, `max(`
 * and `gradient` in the bracket body — and reported, so "37 computed values
 * skipped" is visible rather than the difference between 1,062 and 1,025 being
 * something a reviewer has to notice.
 *
 * **Variants.** `data-[state=open]:`, `aria-[invalid=true]:` and
 * `supports-[…]:` share the bracket syntax and are selectors, not values. The
 * pattern below therefore requires the utility name to be one of exactly three
 * — `text`, `tracking`, `leading` — and the bracket to be followed by a word
 * boundary rather than a `:`. A transform that treated a variant as a value
 * would corrupt behaviour rather than appearance, which is worse and much
 * harder to spot.
 *
 * **Values the table has no entry for.** Left alone and counted. An unmapped
 * value is a gap in the table, which is a decision for whoever owns the scale
 * — not something a script should round. The four in the tree today are `em`
 * units (`text-[1em]`), which are relative to the parent's size and so are a
 * genuinely different thing from the `rem` steps the scale is written in.
 *
 * ## It is idempotent
 *
 * A second run over its own output produces no diff, because the output has no
 * brackets left for the pattern to match. `scripts/tests/` asserts that
 * directly rather than leaving it as a claim.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/codemod-scale.ts <path>...        # rewrite in place
 *   bun run scripts/codemod-scale.ts --dry <path>...  # report only

 * variant is called `text`, `tracking` or `leading`, so `data-[state=open]`,
 * `aria-[invalid=true]` and `supports-[display:grid]` can never match — while
 * the *value* in `data-[state=open]:text-[0.9rem]` still does, which is right,
 * because that half is a size.
 *
 * `(?<![\w-])` and not `(^|[\s"'`])`: the character before a utility is very
 * often a `:` from its own variant (`md:text-[0.9rem]`), and requiring
 * whitespace silently skipped every one of those — without even listing them
 * in the skip report, which is the worst of both.
