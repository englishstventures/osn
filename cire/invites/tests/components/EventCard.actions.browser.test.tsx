/*
 * Which of the card's two actions a guest reads first, MEASURED.
 *
 * `EventCard.test.tsx` asserts the DOM order, which is the mechanism: the pair
 * carries no `order-*` class, so the flex row paints in DOM order. It cannot
 * assert the outcome — happy-dom computes no layout and returns all zeroes from
 * `getBoundingClientRect` — and the outcome is the thing a guest has. A single
 * `order-1` anywhere in the cascade would invert the painted row with every
 * class-presence test still green.
 *
 * Two widths, because a flex row has two shapes and only one of them is the
 * obvious one:
 *
 * - **One line.** The row lays out left to right, so "Event Details" must be the
 *   left-hand button.
 * - **Wrapped.** The row breaks onto two lines, so "Event Details" must be the
 *   line ABOVE. This is not hypothetical and it is not a phone: below `sm` both
 *   buttons are `flex-1` and the Respond button is `overflow-hidden`, which
 *   zeroes its automatic minimum size, so a narrow row shrinks rather than
 *   wrapping. What wraps is the DESKTOP card — at `min-width: 1024px` the root
 *   font-size steps 16px → 17px (`src/styles/global.css`), every rem grows at
 *   once, and the two buttons stop fitting the two-column card's text half.
 *
 * Both cases render into `mx-auto max-w-[640px]`, which is the **classic** pack's
 * events-column cap (`designs/classic/InvitePage.tsx`). Gala caps its column at
 * `max-w-[960px]`, leaving its text half roughly half as full again as it needs,
 * so gala has no wrapped case to measure; its DOM order is covered in
 * `tests/designs/gala/InvitePage.test.tsx`.
