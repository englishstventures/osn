/*
 * The dietary picker inside the sheet it actually ships in, measured.
 *
 * Two claims live here because nothing below the browser tier can check them.
 *
 * **The track overflows inside the sheet, not the other way round.** A
 * `<fieldset>` resolves its min-width from its content, so sixteen pills will
 * push the whole sheet wider than the phone unless every box between them and
 * the scrollport is allowed to be narrower than what it holds. happy-dom
 * computes no layout and cannot tell the two apart — the classes are identical
 * either way.
 *
 * **The picker stays inline at every width here.** The sheet is a `frame`
 * Modal, whose dialog is `overflow-hidden`. `@shared/ui`'s popover mounts its
 * panel into the open dialog — which is what clears the top layer a
 * `showModal()` dialog occupies — and inside a `frame` dialog that puts it in
 * the clip instead. `RsvpModal` therefore pins `shell="inline"` until
 * xchromo/osn#1089 lands, and this is where that is checked against a real
 * viewport rather than a stubbed `matchMedia`.
