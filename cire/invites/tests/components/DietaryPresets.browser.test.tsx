/*
 * The dietary picker inside the sheet it actually ships in, measured.
 *
 * Four claims live here because nothing below the browser tier can check them.
 *
 * **The track overflows inside the sheet, not the other way round.** A
 * `<fieldset>` resolves its min-width from its content, so sixteen pills will
 * push the whole sheet wider than the phone unless every box between them and
 * the scrollport is allowed to be narrower than what it holds. happy-dom
 * computes no layout and cannot tell the two apart — the classes are identical
 * either way.
 *
 * **The picker stays inline at every width here.** The sheet is a `frame`
 * Modal, whose dialog is `overflow-clip`. `@shared/ui`'s popover mounts its
 * panel into the open dialog — which is what clears the top layer a
 * `showModal()` dialog occupies — and inside a `frame` dialog that puts it in
 * the clip instead. `RsvpModal` therefore imports `@cire/ui/dietary-presets`,
 * the entry point with no popover in it, rather than the popover shell the host
 * portal uses. This is where that is checked against a real viewport rather than
 * a stubbed `matchMedia`.
 *
 * **Ticking a pill does not move the sheet.** Each pill hides a real checkbox
 * behind `sr-only`, which is `position: absolute` — so unless the pill itself
 * is a containing block, that input resolves against whatever box is positioned
 * further up and does not travel with the track's sideways scroll. Focusing it
 * then asks the browser to scroll toward a position hundreds of pixels outside
 * the sheet, and the browser obliges by scrolling the `<dialog>`. Measured on
 * the parent of this commit: `dialog.scrollLeft` went 0 → 1213 at 1024px and
 * 0 → 1182 at 414px, and never came back.
 *
 * **The close chip stays on top.** Making each pill `position: relative` is
 * what fixes the above, and it also promotes sixteen boxes past the chip, which
 * is an earlier-in-tree positioned sibling of the scroller with nothing but
 * tree order holding it up. Only a hit test can see that.
