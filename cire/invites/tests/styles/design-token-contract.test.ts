/**
 * Does the invite's mapping onto `@shared/design-tokens` clear the contrast
 * floors the contract promises?
 *
 * This is the app's half of the contract. `@shared/design-tokens` says what the
 * roles are and what each one owes; this asserts that the colours the invite
 * sends to those roles pay it. A shared component rendered here reads the
 * contract, so a mapping that puts secondary ink under 4.5:1 makes every
 * `@osn/ui` primitive illegible on the guest site and nowhere else.
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot see
 *
 * It measures the **evergreen fallback** — the literals in the `@theme` block —
 * because those are the only values that exist at rest. A real invite is
 * repainted at runtime by `paletteRootVars`, which overrides `--color-*` on
 * `<html>` from the organiser's five seeds, and the contract rides through that
 * join unchanged because the mapping aliases `--color-*` rather than the
 * literals behind them.
 *
 * Those derived palettes have their own guard: `invite-theme.test.ts` holds
 * `derivePalette` to the same floors. This one holds the fallback, which is not
 * a hypothetical — `/privacy` and `/terms` never receive a derived palette and
 * paint these literals verbatim.
