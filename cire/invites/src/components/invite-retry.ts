 * The route fetches the invite once per request and passes it to the islands as

 * failed, the shell renders with built-in defaults and the island asks again
 * from the browser, once, after it mounts.
 *
 * Three properties the islands depend on:
 *
 * - **Never on the server.** `onMount` does not run in Solid's server build, so
 *   the Worker never makes this request and the HTML never waits on it. A
 *   `createResource` would: without `ssrLoadFrom: "initial"` Solid's server
 *   build calls its fetcher during the render and Astro's renderer awaits it.
 * - **Never suspends.** Astro hydrates every island inside a `Suspense`, and a
 *   resource refetched there would swap the island for the empty fallback while
 *   in flight. A signal filled from `onMount` has no loading state to suspend on.
 * - **A failure writes nothing.** A non-OK response, a thrown fetch or an
 *   unparseable body leaves the value as it was, so its identity holds and no
 *   effect or memo downstream re-runs for data that did not change.
