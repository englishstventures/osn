/*
 * The structural half of `Reveal`. The animation itself is a real transition on
 * `grid-template-rows` and belongs to the browser tier — happy-dom computes no
 * layout and runs no transitions, so a height assertion here would pass against
 * a component that animates nothing.
 *
 * What is checkable here is the part the animation is built on: the wrapper
 * outlives the content, and the content is genuinely out of the document when
 * closed rather than merely invisible. That second one is the accessibility
 * claim — a collapsed box holding a focusable field is something a keyboard can
 * reach and an eye cannot.
