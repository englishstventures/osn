/**
 * cire's rectangle.
 *
 * One border, one radius, one padding, everywhere — the Overview grid, the
 * settings panels, the listing form, an enquiry in the inbox. The variants are
 * deliberately few: a card earns the gold rule only by being the loudest thing
 * on its screen, and everything else is the neutral one.
 *
 * ## Why the classes are exported too
 *
 * Some cards are `<div>`s and some are `<button>`s that jump to a module, and a
 * `<div role="button">` is a worse answer than either. So the classes are
 * available on their own for the call sites that need a different element, and
 * the component covers the ordinary case. Both read the same strings — Tailwind
 * scans source as text, so a literal inside a function is a literal it finds.
