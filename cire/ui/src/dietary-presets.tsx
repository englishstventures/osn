/**
 * The dietary-requirement picker, inline: every option visible, nothing to open.
 *
 * Every surface that collects dietary requirements renders this or the popover
 * that wraps it, so the vocabulary a caterer eventually reads is decided in
 * exactly one place.
 *
 * On a phone this is the whole control — answering is a tap, and something you
 * must open first is a tap spent before you can start. The checkboxes sit in a
 * horizontally scrolling track.
 *
 * ## Why this file imports no popover
 *
 * `@cire/ui/dietary-presets-popover` is a separate entry point, and the split is
 * a bundle boundary rather than a tidying. A static top-level import is what a
 * bundler follows, so a single component that *could* be either shell shipped
 * Kobalte to the guest invite — which renders the inline shell only — and put
 * that app 8 KB gzip over its size guard. A `<Show>` around the JSX does not
 * help: the cost is the import, not the render.
 *
 * ## Why the trigger is not a `<select>`
 *
 * A native select cannot express "vegetarian AND no nuts", and that is the
 * common case rather than the edge — a guest with two requirements would have to
 * abandon the list and type both into "Other", which is the failure the presets
 * exist to remove.
 *
 * ## A `<fieldset>` with no `<legend>`
 *
 * The grouping is a real fieldset, named by `aria-label` rather than a legend.
 * A caller already wraps this in a fieldset whose legend says whose
 * requirements these are, and on a household sheet that name is load-bearing —
 * "Vegetarian" means nothing without "for Ravi". A second legend inside it
 * pushes screen readers to announce only the innermost, dropping the member's
 * name from every checkbox; an `aria-label` names this group without competing.
 * The band headings are plain text for the same reason.
 *
 * ## The "Other" box is the caller's
 *
 * This renders the presets and nothing else. The free-text box belongs to the
 * form, below this control, because it has to stay reachable while a popover
 * shell is closed — and a guest who has typed something must be able to see it
 * without reopening anything.
