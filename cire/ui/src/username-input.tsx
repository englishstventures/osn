/**
 * A text input for an OSN handle, with a fixed "@" shown ahead of the box —
 * the same affordance `@osn/ui`'s own `UsernameInput` gives the identity app,
 * so a handle looks the same wherever someone types one across the platform.
 *
 * ## Why this is not that component
 *
 * It used to be "because the portal has its own token classes", and that reason
 * is gone: both read the contract now. What remains is the API. `@osn/ui`'s is
 * controlled — `value: string` plus `onInput: (value: string) => void`, with a
 * debounced availability `status` it renders itself. This one takes raw input
 * props, because its one call site is a combobox: it spreads `role`,
 * `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete` and a live
 * `aria-activedescendant` onto the box, and drives its own suggestion list.
 *
 * Two shapes for one idea is worth one of them being thirteen lines. Collapsing
 * them means giving the shared component a combobox mode, which is a larger
 * change than the duplication costs.
 *
 * The typed value never carries the "@" itself — callers get back the bare
 * handle, and the "@" is decoration that can't be deleted or pasted over.
