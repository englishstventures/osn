/**
 * The demo's bottom sheet.
 *
 * It used to be a 130-line port of `cire/invites`' `AnimatedModal`: a
 * `fixed inset-0` scrim, a 40-line `Tab` focus trap, Escape handling, a body
 * scroll lock, focus restore, and an enter/exit animation lazily imported from
 * `Modal.motion`. `@shared/ui`'s `Modal` supplies all of it — the trap, Escape and
 * inertness from `showModal()`, the top layer instead of a `z-index`, and the
 * motion from its own stylesheet.
 *
 * The exit is the part worth knowing about. `close()` drops a dialog out of the
 * top layer immediately, so a CSS-only exit has nothing to paint, and the
 * platform's fix for that — the `overlay` property — is Chrome and Edge only.
 * `Modal` defers the `close()` call instead, which is why this still fades out
 * in Safari. See `wiki/architecture/component-library.md`.
 *
 * What is left here is the sheet's own shape: bottom-anchored on a phone,
 * centred above `md`, and a close button in the corner.
