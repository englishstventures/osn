 * - Keyboard focus held for the same delay (Kobalte's trigger treats focus and

 * - A click or a tap, which is the only path a touch user has — Kobalte's
 *   trigger ignores touch pointers outright, so a hover-only row would be
 *   silently dead on the phone surface. That is also what makes the row a
 *   no-op rather than an unresponsive control: the click opens the offer
 *   instead of opening the module. It toggles, because a touch user has no
 *   pointer-leave to close the card with and tapping the row again is the
 *   obvious way out.
 *
 * The lock is announced in the accessible name, not in the popover, so a
 * screen-reader user hears it while tabbing rather than having to dwell.

 *   to the trigger on close all come from the library.
 *
 * The previous narrow treatment was a horizontally scrolling strip: half the

 * eight at once, each with its hint text.
 *
 * Only one surface is laid out at a time — the other is `display: none`, so
