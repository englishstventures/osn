/**
 * Mobile presentation of the composed preview. The builder's wide layout keeps
 * `PreviewPane` sticky beside the form; below that breakpoint there's no room
 * for a side-by-side column, so the "Preview" button next to the section tabs
 * opens the SAME `PreviewPane` here instead — one preview, two presentations,
 * never two markup sources to drift apart.
 *
 * ## It used to portal, and that is the point of the change
 *
 * This was a `fixed inset-0 z-50` scrim inside a `<Portal>`, and its own
 * comment explained why: the dashboard shell sets `container-type` on its
 * layout boxes, which brings `contain: layout` with it and makes them the
 * containing block for `position: fixed` descendants. That is the trap — a
 * fixed overlay that is only fixed relative to a panel somewhere up the tree.
 *
 * `Modal` renders in the top layer, which is outside the document's stacking
 * contexts entirely, so there is nothing to escape from: no portal, no
 * `z-index`, no scrim element. The focus trap, Escape and the backdrop arrive
 * with it, and this dialog had none of the three.
