/**
 * The portal's role vocabulary, and the only place it decides anything from a
 * role.
 *
 * It mirrors `WeddingRole` in `cire/api/src/middleware/wedding-role.ts`: the
 * wedding's owner, plus the roles a `wedding_hosts` seat may hold. The API is
 * the enforcement — every gate re-checks — so what is decided here is only what
 * the portal OFFERS. An affordance offered to someone the API refuses is a
 * control that 403s, which is the defect this module exists to remove.
 *
 * Two rules hold it together.
 *
 * **Every decision is a switch over the whole vocabulary, with no `default`.**
 * Adding a role fails the type check here until each decision has an answer for
 * it. The shape this replaced was a negative check — `role !== "viewer"` meant
 * "may edit" — which hands every role added later whatever the roles it was
 * written against could do. It was also fail-open in the other direction: a
 * role the portal did not recognise is not `viewer` either, so it was offered
 * every write surface.
 *
 * **An unrecognised role degrades to the least privileged one**, read off the
 * rank map rather than named, so a role added below the current floor moves the
 * floor instead of leaving a literal that grants more than the newest role
 * gets. Roles arrive as JSON, so this is where a string becomes a member of the
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * `@cire/host` depends on neither `@cire/api` nor `@cire/db`, so the exhaustive
 * switches below cannot see a role added to `wedding_hosts.role`.
 * `tests/lib/wedding-roles.contract.test.ts` pins this list to that column.
