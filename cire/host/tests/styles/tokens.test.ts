/**
 * The contrast contract for the two ramps in `global.css`.
 *
 * A drift guard, not a design tool: it exists so that nudging one lightness to
 * make a card look right cannot silently push muted text under 4.5:1 six months
 * later. It reads the stylesheet rather than a table of colours copied into a
 * test, because a copied table is the thing that drifts.
 *
 * **Most of it is now `@shared/design-tokens`.** The hand-written pair table and
 * the alpha-compositing machinery under it moved into the contract's own
 * conformance harness when this portal joined the contract. The harness knows
 * which role owes 4.5:1 and which owes 3:1, and it checks every ink against
 * every ground rather than the subset somebody thought to list — which is how
 * it found three defects the old table could not:
 *
 * - the primary button's label, `text-bg` on a gold fill, at **2.42:1** in light;
 * - the same button's hover, `bg-gold-dim` composited over the page, at
 *   **1.80:1** in dark;
 * - `success` and `warn` on `bg-deep` and `surface-sunk`, at 4.20–4.39:1.
 *
 * `--on-gold` and `--gold-hi` are the tokens that fixed the first two.
 *
 * What stays here is what the contract has no name for. cire carries two accent
 * families, `--osn-accent` is the gold one, and the brand green survives for
 * this product's own use — so this file still owns the green's pairs, and the
 * ramp's *shape* (which is not a contrast question at all).
