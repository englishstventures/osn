 * The portal's role vocabulary. What these pin is the property every affordance
 * in the portal rests on: each role is decided about by name, none inherits a
 * surface by not being mentioned, and a role nobody here knows is offered
 * nothing.
 *
 * `ROLES` is derived from `ROLE_COPY`, which is `satisfies Record<WeddingRole,
 * …>`, so a role added to the vocabulary joins this list by itself and every
 * table-driven case below runs against it. A list written out here would keep
 * passing while saying nothing about the new role.
