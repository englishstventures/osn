/**
 * The dietary-requirement vocabulary: one closed list, shared by everything that
 * reads or writes `rsvps.dietary_presets`.
 *
 * ## Why this is a package and not a file
 *
 * Four consumers, and they cannot reach each other. `@cire/api` validates and
 * serialises; `@cire/ui` renders the picker for the guest sheet, the host editor
 * and the marketing demo. An API that imported the UI package would pull Solid
 * into a Worker, and a UI package cannot be imported by a Worker's schema layer,
 * so the vocabulary is the thing they share and nothing else. That is also why
 * this package has no dependencies at all: adding one puts it in four bundles.
 *
 * ## The data is special-category, including the keys
 *
 * A preset is no less protected than the free text beside it — `halal` and
 * `kosher` reveal religious belief, `nuts` and `shellfish` reveal health. Every
 * gate that covers `rsvps.dietary` covers this too: the Art. 9(2)(a) consent
 * record, the erasure sweep, and the log-redaction deny-list. See
 * `wiki/compliance/dpia/cire-guest-data.md`.

 * Every preset, in canonical order.
 *
 * This order is load-bearing twice: {@link serialisePresets} emits in it, so one
 * selection has exactly one stored string and two rows can be compared; and the
 * picker renders in it, so the bands arrive in a deliberate sequence rather than
 * whatever order a guest happened to tick.
 *
 * Adding a key is free. **Removing one strands saved rows** — a stored
 * `"jain"` whose key no longer exists is dropped by {@link parsePresets} and the
 * guest's answer silently changes — so a removal needs a migration, not an edit.
