/**
 * A thin bar: how much of a budget is spent, how many guests have replied, how
 * much of a checklist is done.
 *
 * Not `<progress>`. That element takes its bar and its track from the platform
 * and resists restyling to a different degree in every engine, and the one thing
 * this has to do is be the app's accent on the app's surface.
 *
 * ## Why the fill is scaled rather than resized
 *
 * The fill is full width and squashed by a transform. Animating `width` puts
 * layout, paint and composite on the main thread for every frame of the move,
 * and a budget screen draws one of these per category — a dozen bars all
 * relaying out together, on the frame a figure was edited. A transform is none
 * of those things.
 *
 * The rounding then has to belong to the track, not to the fill: a transform
 * squashes a radius along with everything else, and a scaled `rounded-full`
 * gives an ellipse that changes shape as the bar moves. So the track clips, and
 * the fill inside it is a plain rectangle.
 *
 * ## `over` is a state, not a clamp
 *
 * A value past its maximum is still drawn full, but in the danger tone, so
 * "spent everything" and "spent more than everything" are not the same picture.
 * The caller decides which it is — this component cannot know whether a maximum
 * is a budget or a capacity.
