/**
 * The label, hint and error scaffolding a form control sits in.
 *
 * ## Why this takes a function instead of rendering the control
 *
 * The forms this replaces wrapped their control in a `<label>` and put the hint
 * inside the label too — which quietly makes the hint part of the input's
 * accessible *name*. A screen reader then announces "RSVP by, the day replies
 * are due, measured in Australia/Sydney" as the name of a date box, and a hint
 * that updates as you type (a running total, a character count) re-announces the
 * whole name on every keystroke. A hint is a description, not a name.
 *
 * Splitting the two means the control needs an id for the label to point at, and
 * the caller should not have to invent one. So `Field` mints the id and hands
 * the wiring — `id`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid` — to a function:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Field label="Wedding name" hint="Shown to guests" errors={nameErrors()}>
 *   {(field) => <Input {...field} value={name()} onInput={…} />}
 * </Field>
 * ```
 *
 * The alternative — a `Field` that renders the control itself from a `type`
 * prop — collapses the moment a field holds a date picker, a currency prefix, a
 * colour swatch or a pair of inputs, and the products between them have all
 * four.
