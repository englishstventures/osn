/**
 * A small pill that names a state: a listing that is live or a draft, an
 * enquiry that is open, quoted or closed.
 *
 * The two call sites it replaces were two different chips — one at `px-3 py-1`
 * and `0.72rem`, the other at `px-2 py-0.5` and `0.68rem`, which put the same
 * idea at two sizes on two screens the same person moves between.
 *
 * ## The tones are contract roles, not raw palette
 *
 * Both call sites reached for fixed Tailwind palette values
 * (`bg-green-500/15 text-green-400`, `bg-blue-500/10 text-blue-400`). Those are
 * fixed sRGB: they do not move when the theme flips, so a blue chip that reads
 * on a dark ground is a bright smear on a light one. These are contract tokens,
 * so they follow whatever the app maps.
 *
 * ## The names are roles, not domains
 *
 * `success`/`pending`/`accent` rather than `live`/`active`/`quoted`. A shared
 * component cannot know that "quoted" is a state a vendor puts an enquiry in;
 * an app maps its own word onto the role at the call site, which is also what
 * stops a second product needing a second set of tones.
 *
 * ## Colour is never the only carrier
 *
 * The chip's text *is* the state — "live", "quoted" — so the hue is decoration
 * on top of a word that already says it. That is why this takes `children` and
 * not just a `tone`: a chip with a tone and no text is a colour nobody can name.
