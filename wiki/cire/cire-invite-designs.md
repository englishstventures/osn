# Invite design selector

A wedding's invite renders as one of several full template packs. The design id
lives on `wedding_invite_customisations.design_id` (0045, default `classic`);
the guest `[slug].astro` SSR fetch resolves it — same link, zero extra
round-trips.

## Pieces

- **Catalog** — `@cire/invite-designs`: `DESIGNS` (`{ id, name, tier }`),
  `DesignId` union, `isDesignId`, `DEFAULT_DESIGN_ID`. Single source of truth
  for api validation, the organiser selector, and the web registry keys.
- **API** — both invite GETs surface `designId`;
  `PUT /api/organiser/weddings/:weddingId/invite/design` (weddingEditor)
  validates against the catalog (unknown → 422) and gates `premium` tiers on
  the `premium_templates` entitlement (403). `inviteService.setDesign` bumps
  `updatedAt` only — never `imagesUpdatedAt` (WT-P-I1).
- **Web** — `cire/invites/src/designs/`: `registry.ts` maps `DesignId` →
  per-design component tree (`classic/` holds the original layout);
  `resolve.ts` (`resolveDesignId`) falls back to classic on unknown ids so a
  guest invite never 500s. Registry imports `.astro`, so vitest tests target
  `resolve.ts` only. Truly shared pieces (LoginSection, RsvpModal,
  DetailsModal, EventCard, PulseAccountLink, invite-theme, invite-images) stay
  in `components/`.
- **Organiser** — Design section in `InviteBuilder`; card per catalog entry,
  lock badge on unentitled premium designs, instant save. **The live previews
  follow the pack** (2026-08-06): `invite/design-layout.ts` names each pack's
  structural signature and `HeroSample`/`SectionSample` render it, so switching
  designs visibly re-shapes the miniature. See [[cire-invite-builder]] §preview.

## The claim and welcome panel

Every pack draws the claim and welcome panel through one component,
[`LoginSection`](../../cire/invites/src/components/LoginSection.tsx). A pack
passes its data and a `layout`; it draws none of the panel's markup.

| `layout` | Pack | Shape | Paints the welcome tone on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `band` (default) | classic | full-bleed section, centred column | the whole section |
| `panel` | gala | 400px bordered card, centred on phones, flush with the page's left gutter from `md` up | the card only |

The two words are the ones the organiser preview uses for the same section
(`welcome` in `design-layout.ts`, see [[cire-invite-builder]]). A layout chooses
class strings only — the frame, the heading size curve, the form width, the
measure, and the greeting's gold: the metal `text-gold` only where the heading
is large text (`band`, 2rem × 0.85 = 27.2px at the smallest heading scale),
`text-gold-ink` elsewhere. Headings follow the organiser's heading typography
in every layout.

Before a claim the panel shows the code entry. After it, the greeting, the
RSVP-by line, and the household's controls in this order:

1. **Pulse account linking** — `PulseAccountLink` inside its own
   `AuthProvider`, both `lazy()`. They load only when a claimed, non-preview
   household is on screen; nothing warms them at idle, so a visitor who never
   claims never downloads them. `tests/components/LoginSection.lazy.test.tsx`
   fails if either import turns static. Hidden in host preview, and it renders
   nothing while linking is off (`cire.account-linking`, [[feature-flags]]).
2. **Plus-one prompt** — the slot is reserved;
   `englishstventures/osn#1084` fills it.
3. **Sign-out** — "Not {name}? Sign out". The panel itself revokes
   `cire_session` (`POST /api/claim/signout`, see [[cire-auth]]), drops the
   restore hint, resets its form and clears the inline styles the unlock
   animation left on it. Outside host preview it also ends the OSN sign-in
   the account link uses (`POST /api/auth/signout`, through an on-demand
   import of `@shared/rp-auth`): the household cookie does not cover it, and
   on a shared device the next household would otherwise find it signed in.
   In preview that session is the organiser's portal sign-in, so it stays.
   The pack's `onSignOut` resets only the pack's own state.

The panel also records the restore hint (`noteClaimed`) when a code is
claimed. The pack keeps the claim result, the reveal choreography
(`revealed`, `formRef`, `welcomeRef`), the session restore and the events
section.

When account linking is on, the Pulse box appears once its probe answers, and
it sits above the events, so it can push them down after the reveal.

## Adding a design

1. Catalog entry in `@cire/invite-designs` (type error in the web registry
   until step 2 lands).
2. New pack folder `cire/invites/src/designs/<id>/` + registry entry. Each pack's
   `Document.astro` owns its font preloads and islands, so guests never
   download another design's assets. The pack renders `<LoginSection>` with a
   `layout`; a new panel shape is a new row in its `LAYOUTS` table, never
   markup of the pack's own.
3. Row in `cire/host/src/components/invite/design-layout.ts` describing how
   the pack is SHAPED, so the builder's preview stops previewing it as Classic.
   Not optional — `design-layout.test.ts` asserts every catalog id has its own
   entry, so step 1 without this fails the organiser suite.
4. Tier `premium` → gate already enforced; no api change.

## Testing seams

- `AppOptions.inviteDesigns` / `createInviteOrganiserRoutes` 5th param inject
  a test catalog (the launch catalog is all-free, so premium-gate tests add a
  fixture design).
