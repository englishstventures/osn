# Component Lab

`@tools/lab` — a bench for building a component before it has anywhere to live.
Storybook's shape (sidebar of stories, live preview, args panel) in roughly 600
lines, on the stack the repo already runs.

```bash
bun run dev:lab          # https://lab.localhost
```

The lab is in the portless map like any other dev server, so it answers on a
name and a branch worktree gets its own copy of it — see [[devloop-urls]]. Its
`DEV_ENV` entry is empty: it renders components, not screens, so it has no
sibling to address.

Nothing here ships. Full usage is in `tools/lab/README.md`; this page records
the decisions behind it.

## The catalogue

`shared/ui` → **Everything** is every component `@shared/ui` exports on one page, each
with its import path — the "what do we already have" view. Six sibling groups
carry the variants and states, and all seven stories live together in
`tools/lab/src/stories/shared-ui/`:

| Sidebar title | File | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shared/ui` | `overview.story.tsx` | Everything, one state each |
| `shared/ui/Button` | `button.story.tsx` | All variants, all sizes, live playground |
| `shared/ui/display` | `display.story.tsx` | Badge, Avatar, Card |
| `shared/ui/forms` | `forms.story.tsx` | Input, Label, Textarea, Select, Field, Fieldset, Checkbox, RadioGroup, UsernameInput, OtpInput |
| `shared/ui/feedback` | `feedback.story.tsx` | Notice, Chip, EmptyState, Stat |
| `shared/ui/data` | `data.story.tsx` | Table, Meter |
| `shared/ui/overlays` | `overlays.story.tsx` | Dialog, Modal, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tabs |

The sidebar title comes from each file's `meta.title`, not from its path, so
moving a story does not move its row. The other two component layers —
`@osn/auth-ui` and `@cire/ui`, see [[component-library]] — have no catalogue
story: every auth view takes an `@osn/client` and a live session, which is the
fixture problem below.

`shared/toast` and `shared/sortable` are benches rather than catalogues: they
exist for the behaviour no test tier can reach. Their unit suites assert the
toast queue and DOM contract, and the sortable's drop semantics against stubbed
rects — happy-dom computes no layout, so a drag test can only check numbers.
What is left over is exactly what a bench is for: whether a drag tracks the
pointer, whether the rows between it and the target shift aside to preview the
drop, whether the grip is findable on hover and visible on focus, and whether a
toast reads on the surface it lands on. The **light · dark** toggle is part of
the toast bench, not chrome around it — the lab borrows `@musubi/social`'s
stylesheet, which is what maps the shadcn ramp onto the `--toast-*` contract, so
the toggle re-themes toasts exactly as the app does. See [[toast]] and
[[drag-and-drop]].

> [!note]
> The shift-aside is the case in point. It shipped broken: `transform` returned
> `null` for every non-dragged row, so the "rows shifting aside" styling
> animated nothing while every drop-semantics test stayed green. A bench shows
> that in a second; no assertion we had could.

App-level components — `pulse/web/src/components`, `cire/invites`,
`musubi/social` — are **not** catalogued. They read from an API client, a router
and an auth session; standing those up in a story means fixtures the repo
deliberately keeps out of app source — see [[component-library]]. The path is
open where a component needs no such context: `pulse/Icon` is catalogued from
a story sitting in `pulse/web/src/components/Icon.story.tsx`, which imports
nothing from the lab and so stays an ordinary file in its own package, and
`cire/host/src/components/ModuleSidebar.story.tsx` does the same for a component
that supplies its own fixtures and imports its own `global.css`. The two
`shared/*` benches are the same shape — bare component exports, no lab imports,
typechecked and linted in their own package like any other file.

## Why not Storybook

Storybook's Solid support (`storybook-solidjs-vite`) is community-maintained and
trails the Vite major line, and this repo is on Vite 8 with Tailwind v4. Adopting
it means a second build config, a second set of version constraints on every
Vite/Tailwind bump, and a `.storybook/` directory that has to be taught about the
token stylesheet anyway.

The parts actually wanted — discovery, a preview, live args, backdrops, a
viewport — are a few hundred lines against `import.meta.glob` and a Solid store.
The parts not wanted (a docs site, an addon API, a test runner, a static build
for publishing) are most of what Storybook is. Revisit if the lab starts growing
addons, or if the design system needs published docs for people outside the repo.

## Shape

| Piece | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery | `src/lab/registry.ts` | `import.meta.glob` over `*.story.tsx`. Globs are literal — a new workspace root means a new line. |
| Story contract | `src/lab/types.ts` | Args are `string \| number \| boolean` — exactly what a control can edit. |
| Args panel | `src/lab/controls.tsx` | The panel itself. |
| Control inference | `src/lab/infer-control.ts` | Editor inferred from the initial value; `controls` overrides. Kept JSX-free so it can be tested. |
| three / canvas | `src/lab/three.tsx` | `ThreeCanvas`, `Canvas2D`, `htmlToCanvas`, `htmlToTexture`, CSS3D layer. |
| Shell | `src/Lab.tsx` | Sidebar, backdrops, viewports, theme, remount, `?bare`. |

Stories live either under `tools/lab/src/stories/` — the `shared/ui` catalogue
in `stories/shared-ui/`, spikes at the top level; the glob is recursive — or
next to a real component under any workspace's `src/` (permanent bench). Both
are found.

## Decisions worth keeping

**The lab imports `musubi/social/src/App.css` rather than copying tokens.** That
file is the source of truth for `--background`, the `.dark` block and the `base:`
variant every `@shared/ui` class is written against. A second copy drifts. The cost
is that Musubi's look is the lab's default; a story with its own design language
imports its own CSS.

**No iframe.** Stories render in the same document as the chrome. Hot reload
stays instant and the code stays small; the trade is isolation — a story that
sets global CSS affects the chrome, and Dialog, DropdownMenu and Popover content
portals into `document.body`, so an open one covers the whole lab window.
`?bare` is the escape hatch, and is also what a screenshot tool should be
pointed at; `?theme=dark` forces a theme, since a screenshot tool cannot click
the toggle.

**Solid is deduped in the lab's Vite config.** Bun installs `solid-js` into each
workspace's own `node_modules` rather than hoisting it, so a story imported from
`pulse/web` resolves a second copy of the runtime. Two Solid instances do not
share a reactive graph — context reads come back undefined and effects silently
never fire. `resolve.dedupe` pins every import to one copy. Any new cross-package
import into the lab depends on this.

**Every export except `meta` is a story.** That is what makes
`export const Thing = () => <div />` work with no config. It also means an
exported helper shows up in the sidebar — keep helpers unexported.

**Stories are not tests, but they do carry a gate.** `tools/lab/tests/stories.test.tsx`
imports every file the registry globs match and renders every story that can run
headless, asserting only that nothing throws and `loadRegistry()` reports no
failures. It says nothing about how a story looks — that is the thing a bench
exists for and the thing no assertion can reach. A component whose *behaviour*
matters still needs a real test — see [[testing-patterns]].

The gate exists because a bench that has silently stopped mounting is worse than
no bench: you reach for it precisely when you are changing what it exercises,
and a story that throws on import becomes a `LoadFailure` row in the sidebar
rather than a red build. `@shared/toast` and `@shared/sortable` are the case
that made it necessary — their co-located benches are the only coverage of drag
feel, the shift/settle animation and toast enter/leave.

**A story that cannot run headless opts out**, in its own `meta`:

```tsx
export const meta = { layout: "fullscreen" as const, headless: false };
```

The smoke test then imports the file and stops there. `headless` defaults to
`true`, so a new story is gated unless its author says why it cannot be, and
opting out is a statement about the story's dependencies — a `WebGLRenderer`
needs a GPU context no headless DOM provides — not about how finished it is.
Both three.js stories in `src/stories/` carry it.

The `test` script also covers two pure helpers, `titleFromPath` and
`inferControl`, because both fail quietly: a wrong title still renders a row, a
wrong control still accepts input.

Rendering `.tsx` needs `vite-plugin-solid`, which every other Solid package here
uses and which the lab's config used to leave out. The plugin prepends a
`@testing-library/jest-dom` setup file to any test run unless an existing
`setupFiles` entry already has `jest-dom` in its path; `shared/test-config/no-jest-dom.ts`
is that entry — the same marker every other Solid package uses, see
[[testing-patterns]]. The DOM itself is per-file: the config's `environment`
stays `node`, and `stories.test.tsx` asks for `happy-dom` with a first-line
`// @vitest-environment happy-dom` pragma, so the pure-helper tests keep paying
nothing for a DOM they never touch.

## HTML in canvas

Three routes, demonstrated in `src/stories/html-in-canvas.story.tsx`:

- `htmlToCanvas` — DOM-authored artwork rasterised for canvas compositing.
- `htmlToTexture` — the same raster as a `CanvasTexture` in a 3D scene.
- `css3d` + `CSS3DObject` — live, clickable DOM transformed by the scene camera.
  Real hit-testing, but it composites *over* the WebGL layer: geometry cannot
  occlude it and it takes no lighting.

The first two go through an SVG `foreignObject`, which loads nothing external
(no web fonts, no remote images) and parses its markup as XML (every tag closed).
Both limits belong to the technique, not the helper.

## WebGPU and TSL

The WebGPU half of three.js is a different API from the WebGL half: `three/webgpu`
for the renderer and the node materials, `three/tsl` for shaders written as
JavaScript nodes rather than GLSL strings. The installed three (0.185.1) exports
both.

A third-party skill covers that API — `dgreenheck/webgpu-claude-skill`, installed
here as `webgpu-threejs-tsl` and invoked by an agent as `/webgpu-threejs-tsl`. It
holds renderer setup, TSL syntax, node materials, compute shaders,
post-processing, custom WGSL, device loss and feature limits, with runnable
examples and two templates.

`ThreeCanvas` is no help to a story that follows it. It builds a `WebGLRenderer`
(`src/lab/three.tsx:135`), and a `WebGPURenderer` needs an `await renderer.init()`
before its first frame, so a WebGPU story owns its own renderer and canvas. It
needs `headless: false` too, for the same reason the two existing three.js
stories do.

Owning the renderer means owning everything `ThreeCanvas` did for you, and the
skill's examples are written as standalone pages rather than as lab stories, so
none of it is in the code they hand you. Four things to put back, all of them
worked out in `src/lab/three.tsx`:

| Put back | Why | Worked version |
|---|---|---|
| Teardown in `onCleanup` — `setAnimationLoop(null)`, dispose the scene, `renderer.dispose()`, `forceContextLoss()`, remove the canvas | A browser keeps about sixteen GPU contexts and drops the oldest to make room, which may be the story on screen. Hot reload runs this path on every save | `three.tsx:211-225` |
| `setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2))` | The examples pass the raw ratio. On a 3× display that is nine device pixels per CSS pixel against four, so 2.25× the fragment work every frame | `three.tsx:136` |
| A `ResizeObserver` on the host element, not a `window` resize listener | A story is a panel inside the lab, not the window, and an unthrottled listener reallocates the swapchain and every full-screen target through a drag-resize | `three.tsx:166-181` |
| Objects held in variables the frame callback closes over | `templates/webgpu-project.js:243` finds its mesh with `scene.children.find(…)` inside the animation callback — a linear scan per frame | — |

> [!warning] The skill is not ours to edit

## Gates

`tools/lab` is a workspace, and the root `workspaces` array names each one in
`tools/` by path (`tools/lab`, `tools/oxlint/house`) rather than globbing
`tools/*`. The glob would sweep in `tools/oxlint/anti-slop`, which is vendored
upstream source with no package.json of its own.
`scripts/validate-changesets.sh` scans `tools/` alongside the product directories
so a changeset naming `@tools/lab` validates; `fmt` and `fmt:check` list the two
workspace paths explicitly, for the same reason, so the vendored tree is never
reformatted.
