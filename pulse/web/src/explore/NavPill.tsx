 * button, except one had `hover:opacity-90` and the other had no hover state at
 * all. And both reached the coral through an inline
 * `style={{ background: "var(--pulse-accent)" }}` plus a
 * `text-[var(--pulse-accent-fg)]` arbitrary value — the brand colour was not in
 * the Tailwind theme, so there was no utility to write. It is now
